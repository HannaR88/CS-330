How do I approach designing software?
It usually relies on the software I aim to create when I'm designing one. Although most of my designs are simple rather than sophisticated, they still accomplish their goals without giving the impression that the application is cluttered. Too many features and settings might be confusing and make using the application more difficult.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? Everything that I did to design my project was new to me. All the desing skills have been very helpful. Before this course I did not have any experience in 3D coding, nor any experience with OpenGL. 


How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? I had a lot of trial and error, so that did teach me a lot. Making sure I understand the requirements of the project is important, code being clean and logical is also important. I am not sure what the future holds for me, but it will be in computer science. Not sure I will do any computer graphics, but I will take this skill with me and utilize it whenever I need to. 

How do I approach developing programs? Before beginning a project, I like to make a plan. Before utilizing any program, I like to look over the manual because it gives me ideas for what to accomplish. After researching, I like to organize the project so that I don't become distracted from my goals. When I first start programming, I prefer to check everything twice and make sure my code works after compiling.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? The development startegies that I used while working on my 3D scene was to incorporate different libraries provided, as well as the existing formulas into my code. This saved a lot of time, and I didn't have to start code from scratch. 

How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? 
I believe that the iterative nature of each step allowed me to better understand the concepts and picture my project. However, I needed a lot of time to fully grasp some ideas. I believe that dividing the job into smaller components improved my sense of progress.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? Computer science is a crucial component of my ambition to become a professional software developer who specializes in full-stack web development and mobile development. An other option is finding something in the cyber security field. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? Computational graphics and visualizations, in my opinion, have improved my understanding of the visuals and game engines developed by other engineers. I will undoubtedly need more time to commit to acquiring these abilities and concepts if I were to enter this career.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? I now know how to use pre-existing libraries, formulas, and code thanks to computational graphics and visualization. It has also improved my understanding of color, space, and visuals. My professional goals of becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer and Mobile Developer will benefit significantly from this.
